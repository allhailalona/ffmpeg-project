address various bugfixes and styling issues:
	overflow tables and make sure the table takes w-full etc with backgrounds
	introduce eslint and prettier with electron toolkit and fix entire project
	ts proof entire project

	fix the Chrome Devtools error which haunts me for dozens of commits

	using eslint and prettier with electron-vite:
		there are several configs which are imported automatically when initalizing electron-vite, those are written in the legacy version of eslint configs.
		I couldn't find a way to access those pacakages with the new format, which is why I DON'T use those extensions. I will however, include the prettier plugin.

		note this is NOT about using ESM/CommonJS, this about the config format chosen for elint, which can be setup with either ESM/CommonJS
